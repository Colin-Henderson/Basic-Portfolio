				<h2>A Bit About Me</h2>
					<hr>
					<p>Born in Richmond, VA and raised in Mechanicsville VA since the ripe age of 5. I grew up the eldest of 3 boys so you could say I was the trailblazer (whether thats good or bad I will never know.) Fishing was actually my first passion after being taught by my Grandfather fishing for Flounder down in Myrtle Beach. Growing up I would fish the james for radioactive catfish or the rappahanock for spot or croaker.</p>

					<p>An avid sports fan; I am unfortunately loyal to the Redskins (Won a superbowl the year before I was born and nothing since), the Orioles (birds apparently migrate in the fall so they never play in October), the Gamecocks (Well we did beat 'Bama in 2010) and finally the Hornets (just because Michael Jordan owns the team doesnt mean you'll win games). </p>

						<p> I currently live in Richmond after moving back about a year ago from southwest Virginia. Upon graduation from Radford University I landed a job as a Technical Recruiter. I am grateful for my time as a Technical Recruiter because it was the catalyst I needed to spark my interest in Development. I consider myself to be highly-creative and a problem solver by nature so immersing myself in the technical field, albeit recruiting, was something I couldnt resist looking into. </p>

							<p>So fast forward to now, I am currently enrolled in the University of Richmond School of Professional & Continuing Studies in hopes of obtaining my Full-Stack Certificate in what will be the beginning to a fullfilling career in Development. </p>
